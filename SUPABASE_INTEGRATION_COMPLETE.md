- Connect to your database
- Set up real-time subscriptions

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Open your app
2. Go to the registration screen
3. Create a new account
4. Check your Supabase dashboard under **Authentication** → **Users**
5. You should see your new user account

### Step 4: Test Database Operations

1. Create a meal plan in your app
2. Go to Supabase dashboard → **Table Editor**
3. Select the `meal_plans` table
4. You should see your meal plan data
